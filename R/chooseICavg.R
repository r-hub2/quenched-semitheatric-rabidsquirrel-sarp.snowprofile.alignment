#' Get index of appropriate initial condition average profile
#'
#' To average a set of snow profiles, [dbaSP] requires a snow profile as initial condition (IC) to start the algorithm. To prevent persistent weak layers (PWLs) and crusts
#' from being averaged-out during the call to `dbaSP`, it is advised to start the algorithm with a best-guess IC. This best guess IC contains a large number of PWLs and crusts to ensure
#' that the most prevalent ones actually make their way into the final average profile. This function helps to choose meaningful IC profiles. See Details or (better) the source code
#' for how this function picks the profiles.
#'
#' This function first computes how many PWLs and how many crusts are in the profiles that have a close to median total snow height HS.
#' Each of these profile is then divided into several vertical levels (by [numberOfPWLsPerVerticalLevel]).
#' nPWL and nCR profiles are then randomly picked from the profiles that have PWLs or CR in most vertical levels and additionally have a rather large number of PWLs/CR overall.
#' The larger `n`, the more profiles with decreasing number of PWLs/CR in different levels are also returned. Note that this function is best applied
#' to large profile sets to obtain semi-random results. For small sets, the indices returned can actually be deterministic since the pool of relevant profiles is too small.
